# Categories Management Feature

## Overview
This feature adds comprehensive category management to the React Admin panel, allowing administrators to create, update, and delete product categories.

## Features

### 1. Categories Page (`/categories`)
- **Add New Categories**: Create categories with name and description
- **Edit Categories**: Update existing category information
- **Delete Categories**: Remove categories (only if no products are associated)
- **View Product Count**: See how many products are in each category
- **Responsive Table**: Clean, organized display of all categories

### 2. Enhanced Products Page
- **Category Dropdown**: Products now use a dropdown to select categories instead of manual ID entry
- **Category Names**: Product cards display category names instead of IDs
- **Real-time Integration**: Categories are fetched from the backend and updated in real-time

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Integration
- Uses existing category endpoints from Node.js server
- Full CRUD operations supported
- Product count aggregation for each category
- Validation to prevent deletion of categories with associated products

### Frontend Components
- **Categories Page**: `src/pages/Categories/index.js`
- **API Helpers**: Enhanced `src/helpers/nodeAuth_helper.js` with category functions
- **Navigation**: Added Categories link to sidebar
- **Routing**: Updated `src/routes/allRoutes.js`

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /categories` - Fetch all categories
- `POST /categories` - Create new category
- `PUT /categories/:id` - Update category
- `DELETE /categories/:id` - Delete category

## Usage

### Managing Categories
1. Navigate to **Categories** in the sidebar
2. Use the form at the top to add new categories
3. Click **Edit** on any category to modify it
4. Click **Delete** to remove categories (only if no products are associated)

### Creating Products with Categories
1. Navigate to **Products** in the sidebar
2. When creating a new product, use the **Category** dropdown to select from available categories
3. The product will be properly associated with the selected category

## Database Schema
The categories table includes:
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `name` (Required)
- `description` (Optional)
- Product count is calculated via JOIN with products table

## Security
- Category management requires admin authentication
- Categories with associated products cannot be deleted
- All operations are validated on both frontend and backend

## Future Enhancements
- Category image upload
- Category hierarchy (parent-child relationships)
- Category-specific product attributes
- Bulk category operations
